# FastAPI for Svelte Static Resource Serving

This project is a demonstration of how to use FastAPI to provide static resource serving for Svelte. FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

Here's what we've done.

1. Init a simple svelte project by vite.
2. Built it to a static directory.
3. Use FastAPI to provide static resource serving.

You only need to take a look at [app.py](./app.py), other code files are merely generated by vite.

It would be a greate start if you'd like to use python as a backend and integrate the front-end and back-end together might be a pleasant choice for someone like
